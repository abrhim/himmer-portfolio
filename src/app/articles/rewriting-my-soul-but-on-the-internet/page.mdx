I have a lot of thoughts. Some positive, some negative, but almost all go unprocessed because I don't have a solid system to process them. I am genuinely concerned on much energy I put into thinking for it to go unprocessed and to become nothing. 

Usually I find someone to talk to, but I am finding it harder and harder to find people who want to go as deep as I want. So instead of digging down the bottom of the barrel in Liberty Mo, I'm going to spread my wings and share my thoughts on the internet. My guess is that one or two people may read this, but I suspect, and there seems to be a [significant](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/emotional-and-physical-health-benefits-of-expressive-writing/ED2976A61F5DE56B46F07A1CE9EA9F9F) [amount](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305886/) of [evidence](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/docs/230/2014/Papers%20from%20previous%20years/Mar.pdf) and [suggestion](https://jamesclear.com/journaling-one-sentence) for this, that the greatest benefit is really going to be for me.

So here's to a new year writing and being a better self. Hope to see you around.
